# Start With an Idea
Notes for a training/learning course for developing ideas into something real
- What are you building?
- What does it do?
- What service or purpose does it fulfill?
- Who is it for?
- Why do you want to build this?
- Why should anyone else care?

### Notes
- At each stage I can provide ideas and examples to help people decide what to work on.
- Help people to determine the best tools and skills based on what they want to do.
  - What skills do you have?
  - What skills do you need?
- Point them to resources and maybe even mentors.
- Encourage people to pay it forward and back.
